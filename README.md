# crawley_code - Use Case of a HashMap keys to quickly switch the values of a character if there is match.

The code in the package encodedXander can read an INPUT file an then use a RULE HASHMAP where you can say convert vowels aeiou TO AEIOU or reverse them or even convert a comma to a pipe character. You can add, remove or print all the rules. There are some restrictions in what rules you can add. Though it can read and write using Binary files the HASHMAP for your rules assumes STRINGS. OK, there are some USE CASE limitations. You have an option of an OUTPUT file as well. 

<br />To run this example use the <b>main</b> method in <b>ReadWriteBinary</b> Class
<br />
<br />It creates the rules for uppercasing or lower casing the vowels in the input file file1IN.csv which is assumed to be on a Windows path of c:\temp It creates the converted output file in the same folder
<br  />
<br />You can switch other characters as well using this mini pattern - like commas with the pipe symbol
<br />
<br />Example output file is also included in this repository
